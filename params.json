  "body": "# Cordova Template for Phaser, using Typescript and Jed\r\nA Cordova/PhoneGap template for building a Phaser game using Typescript.  Both [Jed](https://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/) and [po2json](https://github.com/mikeedwards/po2json) have been included to assist in internationalization (i18n) efforts.\r\n\r\nThe workflow provided by this template will assume control of the `www` directory.  Any content added or changed in this directory manually will be overridden by the provided Grunt tasks.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n* [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) via [Bower](https://bower.io/) \r\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n  * [Express](https://github.com/blai/grunt-express) - Provides a Grunt-based server used in tandem with `grunt-contrib-watch` to provide live-reloading when debugging.\r\n* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\r\n  * [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) - Verify TypeScript against Phaser's recommended code styles.\r\n  * [Typings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typings) - Provides typing information for TypeScript development.\r\n* [Jed](https://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/)\r\n  * [po2json](https://github.com/mikeedwards/po2json) - Convert your translation files into JSON that can be used by Jed.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\nTo use this template with `cordova`, create a new Cordova project with the `--template` parameter.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncordova create <directory> <project-scope> <project-name> --template cordova-phaser-ts-jed \r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: `<project-scope>` should resemble `com.example.<directory>`, although the decision is ultimately yours.\r\n\r\nOnce the project has been created, run the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installation, all packages should be ready to use in the `<directory>` indicated.  You should update the generic `package.json` and `src/html/index.html` files to with the name and version of the project, as applicable.\r\n\r\nTo initially populate the `www` directory, or update the `www` directory with any changes, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt build\r\n```\r\n\r\nTop open the the project in your default browser, use the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile being served, you can use `F5` (or `<cmd>-R`) to reload the page in the browser.  Use `<ctrl>-C` on the command line to stop this task.\r\n\r\nOr, if you plan to actively develop your project and need live reload, use the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will copy any asset or static file changes immediately, as well as recompile any changed TypeScript files.  The task will automatically reload the page opened in your browser once the changes propagate into the `www` directory.\r\n\r\nThe page served by this task can also be reloaded in the browser, or aborted on the command line.\r\n\r\nIf you only want to propagate changes without interacting with the browser, you can use the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\nThis template organizes content with the following structure:\r\n\r\n- **assets** - Used to store all of your project's assets.  All content will be copied into `www/assets` when the project is built.\r\n  - **.gitignore** - Used to make sure the `assets` directory is created by the template.  Can be removed.\r\n- **src** - All source files related to your project.\r\n  - **html** - All files and directories here are copied into `www` without any processing.\r\n    - **index.html** - A default HTML file.\r\n  - **ts** - All TypeScript files should be placed in this directory.\r\n    - **states** - A sample directory of Phaser states.\r\n      - **boot.ts** - A sample Phaser state that is called when the app is started.\r\n      - **preload.ts** - A sample Phaser state that is called directly after the boot state is completed.\r\n    - **main.ts** - A sample Phaser bootstrap that loads Phaser on page load and begins the boot state. \r\n- **www** - All compiled code and static files are housed here for Cordova/PhoneGap to access.\r\n  - **.gitignore** - Used to make sure the `www` directory is created by the template.  Can be removed.\r\n\r\nOnce `grunt build` has been run, the `www` directory will have the following structure.\r\n \r\n- **assets** - Copy of the base `assets` directory.\r\n- **js** - All JavaScript files are copied into this directory.\r\n  - **jed.js** - Needed for using the Jed library.  Copied from NPM.\r\n  - **main.js** - All TypeScript files are compiled and placed into this singular JavaScript file.\r\n  - **phaser.js** - Needed for using Phaser.  Copied from Bower.\r\n- **index.html** - The same file found under `src/html`.\r\n\r\nThe following configuration files are provided to ease into the workflow provided by this template.\r\n\r\n- **bower.json** - Bower equivalent of the NPM-based `package.json` file.\r\n- **config.json** - Unused at this time.\r\n- **tsconfig.json** - Configuration used when compiling TypeScript code.\r\n- **tslint.json** - Configuration when using TSLint to check for code style mistakes.  Defers to Phaser's recommended settings.\r\n- **typings.json** - Used by the Typings library to provide type-hinting `.d.ts` files. \r\n\r\n## Grunt Tasks\r\nYou can always use `grunt -h` to list all available tasks.  Below is a list of customized tasks provided by this template.\r\n\r\n- **build** - Clears all content out of `www`, then compiles and copies code and assets into the same directory.\r\n- **serve** - Start a server and open `www` in your default browser.  Press `<ctrl>-C` on the command line to stop the task.\r\n- **debug** - Same as `serve`, but provides live reload for the opened web page. The `watch` task is called to trigger the live reload.  Press `<ctrl>-C` on the command line to stop the task.\r\n- **check** - Run all linters and code validation tasks.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright 2016 Craig A.
